  To get started, navigate to your project
  root, and type:
  
  $ rake pretty_flash:install
  
  That will copy all of the necessary assets
  to their appropriate homes.
  
  !! WARNING: there is no protection against
     file collision, so your files will be
     overwritten if they already exist. You
     may want to check that first! (see the
     pretty_flash/assets/ to check)
  
  Enjoy!
